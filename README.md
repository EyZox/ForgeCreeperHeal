This mod is unmaintened, I currently look to create a new for Sponge.

Have a look here : https://github.com/RedRelay/SpongeCreeperHeal !

Sponge is more adapted to this projet, and maintenance cost is lower.
I earn some experiences in developement in the last year, even if I am more a Node.js and Salesforce e-commerce developper right now. I will take all my new skill, to made a largely better structured and cleaner code for Sponge.
Stay tuned ;)
